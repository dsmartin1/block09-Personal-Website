README

This is a personal website for my portfolio.
It should improve greatly over the course of this program.
I hope.

To do:

- Remove fixed sidebar, convert to fixed header
- Make sidebar retractable (js)
- Convert CSS grid layout to flex for better scaling [New Branch]
- Sample ad space?
- Merge CSS into single style sheet


Updates:

12/20 - added prototype template for testing page layout
