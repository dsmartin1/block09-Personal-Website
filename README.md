# block09-Personal-Website
README

This is a personal website for my portfolio.
It should improve greatly over the course of this program.
I hope.

To do:

- Review color scheme
- Fix spacing problems with grid elements (or consider conversion to flex)
- Fix media scaling issues
- Add heading child class .flex-top
- Fix unordered lists in Portfolio page and add heading element
- Improve on rules for alignment/margins within .context-box grid elements
- Reduce overall instances of inline style adjustments

Updates:

12/20 - added prototype template for testing page layout

12/21 - start of branch format_v2

12/22 - revisions to spacing and presentation, met general block09 requirements
